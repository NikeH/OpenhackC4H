# OpenHack 4-6/12 2015 in Malmö
This was the first ever OpenHack! It was held in Malmö at the office of [Jayway](http://jayway.se) with about 80 participants. The teams were very diverse and contained students from high school and university, as well as entrepreneurs and every-day-workers. The participants was split about half and half between Danes and Swedes, but also included other nationalities, including newly arrived from Syria and Yemen.

The general theme of the hackathon concerned humanitarian aid with an indirect focus on the refugee crisis which was a very active topic during the time. Teams had the opportunity to take on challenges from a number of aid organizations, as well as form a Kenyan-driven open source project called [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com), which had representatives on-site from Nairobi.

During the weekend participants could stretch the joints and muscles during yoga-sessions, relax their brains with pool, dart or video games, and shill out with some live DJ-lounge music. Technical coaches and representatives from the aid organizations circulated to help the teams with issues and focusing their work.

After 48 intense hours 12 teams presented their achievements in-front of a diverse and competent jury. The solutions proposals and prototypes ranged from IOT hardware with connecting back-end, and complex data-mining with IBM Watson, to 3D graphic data visualization, and mobile apps for with social media functionality.
